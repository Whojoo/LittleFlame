# LittleFlame
First 3D game I worked on with some other students.

# The game
This little game is about a little flame in a big, burnable world.  
The little flame is from outer space, created from a meteor. This meteor split up in our atmosphere.  
The little flame misses his friends from the other meteors so he decides to find a path to his friends.

# The project
Our university gave us a project for which we had to create our own game.
We had never worked with XNA before and we had never created a 3D game before and we felt like using XNA to create a 3D
game would be a great experience.

In the end we had a great time working on this game and we learned a lot.
