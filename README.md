# LittleFlame
First 3D game I worked on with some other students.

# The game
This little game is about a little flame in a big, burnable world.  
The little flame is from outer space, created from a meteor. This meteor split up in our atmosphere.  
The little flame misses his friends from the other meteors so he decides to find a path to his friends.

# The project
Our university gave us a project for which we had to create our own game.
We had never worked with XNA before and we had never created a 3D game before and we felt like using XNA to create a 3D
game would be a great experience.

In the end we had a great time working on this game and we learned a lot.

# Issues
This was a new experience for us, working with 3D. But at the same time we wanted to showcase this on a Xbox 360.  
First tests were all done on a pc since it was just faster than constantly sending everything to a Xbox 360. At one point we decided to have 1 person test the game on a Xbox 360 as well. One thing we did not pay attention to is the available RAM, or memory management of any kind.  
So we had to find all memory leaks and we had to think about memory usage. I think that for 3D games this was our biggest lesson, make sure you do not carelessly use memory.
